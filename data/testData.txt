Turkish film ‘Babamın Sesi’ set to open in German theaters

The drama, which also stars its co-director Doğan, was promoted in a gala screening on Monday night in Hamburg with Doğan in attendance. The film will open in 12 German cities, including Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich, the filmmakers’ publicist said in a written statement issued on Monday.

“Babamın Sesi,” which premiered in January at the Netherlands’ International Film Festival Rotterdam, is set to open in Turkish cinemas on Friday. The drama recounts the fictional story of a young man who tries to find out about his father through old tapes after learning that he is to become a father. Based on a real life event in Zeynel Doğan’s family, the film also stars Doğan’s mother, Basê, and his wife, Gülizar.

The Turkish-German-French co-production won the best film prize at the Altın Koza (Golden Boll) International Film Festival in the southern Turkish city of Adana in September. The film also shared the best screenplay award with “Tepenin Ardı” (Beyond the Hill) in this year’s İstanbul International Film Festival, where it had its Turkish premiere.

New Zealand makes use of ‘Hobbit’ films 
From a giant, bug-eyed Gollum sculpture looming over passengers at Wellington Airport to promotional banners covering the facades of office blocks, the upcoming “The Hobbit” movie is impossible to ignore in New Zealand.

Tourism chiefs, hoping to recreate the surge in visitors inspired by the original “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy, have launched a massive marketing campaign around director Peter Jackson’s latest Middle Earth three-parter.

“The Hobbit” movies use New Zealand’s mountainous scenery as a backdrop, amounting to what some tourism insiders gleefully describe as a nine-hour-long advertisement for the country’s rugged charms.

Tourism New Zealand chief executive Kevin Bowler says the films offer the country invaluable global exposure that can be converted into increased visitor arrivals. “We aim to show potential travellers that the fantasy of Middle Earth is in fact the reality of New Zealand,” he said.

But behind the hype, official figures show the first of the new movies “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey” cannot come soon enough for an industry struggling for momentum almost a decade on from the original Middle Earth saga.

New Zealand’s international visitor arrivals jumped from 1.5 million to 2.4 million between 2000 and 2006 on the back of “The Lord of the Rings” films, but have remained flat at about 2.5 million for the past four years.

Tourism operator David Gatward-Ferguson said that when the first “Rings” film was released in 2001, the industry was surprised by the influx of visitors wanting to travel to places featured in the movie.

‘Hamlet’ debuts in Kurdish
William Shakespeare’s celebrated play, “Hamlet,” made its Kurdish language premier in the Dutch capital of Amsterdam. The Kurdish play’s inaugural performance by the Diyarbakır Metropolitan Municipality City Theater and the Dutch Rast Theater took place at the Stadsschouwburg Theater. The play was produced by Rast Theater in co-operation with the Cultural department of Diyarbakır in the hopes that this adaption of “Hamlet” would bring Kurdish culture to the attention of a wider international audience.

In addition to Kurdish people living in the Netherlands, the Dutch showed great interest in the play as well. Directed by Rast Theater General Art Director Celil Toksöz, the play casts Yavuz Akkuzu as Hamlet and also features Özcan Ateş, Elvan Koçer, Mesut Erenol, Mehmet Emin Yalçınkaya, Serdar Geren, İsmail Oyur, Rojda, Gülseven Medar and Ali Tekbaş.

“Hamlet” was translated into Kurdish by Kawa Nemir with the title “Hamlet– Hebun an Nebun” and music was specially composed for this adaptation. After touring the Netherlands and Sweden, the play will be staged in Diyarbakır on Nov. 9.

Turkish Government Seeks End to 8-Week Hunger Strike 
ISTANBUL — Kurdish inmates in dozens of Turkish prisons are conducting a hunger strike to pressure the government to grant greater Kurdish rights and better conditions for a jailed militant leader. With concerns growing about the condition of the hunger-strikers, efforts are intensifying to resolve the protest.

For nearly 60 days, about 700 imprisoned Kurdish activists have been drinking water with sugar, salt and vitamins, but no solid food.  

They are demanding the right to use the Kurdish language in court cases and in school. They are also demanding free access to lawyers for the imprisoned leader of the Kurdish rebel group, the PKK, Abdullah Ocalan.

Turkey's medical association is expressing concern about the condition of some of the hunger-strikers and warns fatalities are possible.

Pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party parliamentary deputy Ertugrul Kurkcu says resolution of the protest could be near.

"Everything is now hinging around the talks between the BDP (Peace and Democracy Party) leaders, the minister of justice, and the president," said Kurkcu. "I think there is going to be a final decision by the government, and I am optimistic."

Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc announced the government is prepared to meet one of the strikers' demands.

He says the prime minister has agreed people should be able to defend themselves in court in the language in which they can best express themselves. He said the justice minister is drafting a bill to send to parliament to become law.

The announcement came as a surprise to much of the Turkish media. For weeks, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan dismissed the protest, claiming the hunger strikers were all in good health and saying he would not be blackmailed. But pressure has been building on the government.

Protests across the country are on the rise amid media reports about the deteriorating health of the hunger-strikers. Some demonstrations have ended in violence.  

Pro-Kurdish deputy Kurkcu, who met with some of the prisoners, warns no one should doubt their commitment.

"They are absolutely determined because these people have met with every severe condition of being and have been subject to heavy torture, and have been spending at least 14 years in prison," said Kurkcu. "I met one person who was 32 years in prison. So these people are very serious when they speak about matters relating with life and death."

The prospect of prisoners dying is expected to lead to increasing international pressure, in particular from the European Union, which Turkey is hoping to join.  

On Saturday, Erdogan strongly attacked the protest and sent a veiled threat to the imprisoned PKK leader that the majority of Turkey wants a restoration of the death penalty. Ocalan was sentenced to death, but it was commuted to a life sentence after the abolition of capital punishment in 2004.

Political columnist Cengiz Aktar of Today’s Zaman newspaper warns the country is at a critical point.

"The minister of justice is really trying to do his best, but the prime minister is systematically adding oil to the fire and this (is) very dangerous," said Aktar. "And I hope it will not get there, but the ingredients of a civil war is slowly piling up."

Tensions are already high with a marked upsurge in fighting this year between the Turkish state and Kurdish rebels. Observers warn tensions will rise further if fasting prisoners start to die. Turkey has a history of such fatal protests. Activists say more than 100 prisoners associated with hunger strikes against prison conditions have died in the past two decades.

Americans Assess Meaning of Obama's Reelection 

WHITE HOUSE — Political analysts and experts in Washington are evaluating how President Barack Obama’s re-election might affect America’s future. Both Democrats and Republicans are looking at why and how Obama won and Mitt Romney lost, and also how they can move forward.

“For the United States of America, the best is yet to come!” said the president to cheers and applause.

The morning after Obama’s victory speech, many Americans are debating how to push his vision forward.  

At the Brookings Institution, experts at a morning-after forum discussed the overall meaning of Obama’s election win, and particularly what it could mean for the Republican Party. Senior fellow Thomas Mann said the election outcome shows that Republican lawmakers’ strategy of routinely opposing the president’s policies failed in forcing Obama out of office. He said Republicans on Capitol Hill gambled and lost.

“They played an all-out opposition party. ‘We are [against] everything. We will stop it where we can. We will delay it otherwise, and if it manages to pass, we will discredit it.’” said Mann.

Mann believes some Republican lawmakers are discussing an alternate strategy in which they negotiate with the president, if Obama wants to cooperate.

“At least a dozen Republicans, I think, will be unwilling to be whipped by [Senate Minority Leader] Mitch McConnell into a filibuster opposition strategy to the president. And it seems to me there will be openings for the president as a consequence,” said Mann.

Brookings guest scholar Jonathan Rauch said he also sees a too-conservative approach as one reason for Republican nominee Mitt Romney’s defeat.

“I think Romney was done in by the fact that he could not get far enough to the center credibly enough. He had to go too far right in the primaries. And the reason for that is you have some fierce constituencies in the Republican Party that do not want the party to change,” said Rauch.

Rauch said that as he did in 2008, Obama won by appealing to a coalition of Hispanics and other ethnic minorities, young voters and women.  He said Republicans did little to solicit votes from those growing segments of the U.S. population.

“You saw Hispanics increase their share, and you saw women really come out for Obama.  The social issues did not help the Republicans there. I think it is now going to be clear to a lot of intelligent Republicans - like [Senator] Lindsey Graham, who has already said this - that 2012 has to be the last year when Republicans run as the party of angry white men. That is just not enough votes any more,” said Rauch.

Meanwhile, the U.S. business community, which often clashes with Obama, is setting its course for the next four years in response to the priorities the president laid out in his victory speech.

“Reducing our deficit, reforming our tax code, fixing our immigration system, freeing ourselves from foreign oil. We have got more work to do," said Obama.

In a written statement congratulating Obama, the Business Roundtable urged him to focus on deficit reduction and tax reform, and to ease regulatory controls for businesses.

‘Gender equality needs to be secured in new charter’
Turkish Family and Social Policies Minister Fatma Şahin said earliar today that gender equality needs to be secured in Turkey’s new Constitution.

The third International Women Entrepreneurship and Leadership Summit was held Nov. 8 at the Congress Center in Istanbul’s Harbiye district.

The theme of the summit was “the rising power of women in the new world order.” Şahin; the head of the Turkish Industry and Business Association (TÜSİAD), Ümit Boyner; Dutch Housing and Environment Minister Sybilla M. Dekker attended the summit, as well as several local and international figures.

In her speech, Şahin emphasized the importance of organization for women and gender equality. “The entire potential of the society should be activated regardless of gender. In this respect, it is important that we know our course.”

The Justice and Development Party (AKP) government has reformed civil law, Şahin said. “Putting these changes into practice was extremely important. In the new Constitution, gender equality, in the real sense, should be assured.”

Boyner said Turkey was in last place among 135 countries regarding gender equality. She also pointed to the AKP’s goals for 2023, saying, “Without providing gender equality, progress is not possible.”
TÜSİAD has 3,500 member companies, Boyner said, stating that female members constituted only 35 percent, whereas the rate of female executives was 19 percent. She emphasized the importance of raising this figure.

Turkey's Mehmet Okur ends basketball career 

Turkish player Mehmet Okur announced his retirement from basketball yesterday, adding it would take effect immediately.

The former Utah Jazz and Detroit Pistons center issued a statement to announce his decision.
“Due to a string of injuries in the last three years, I have come to understand that I will not be the Mehmet Okur I used to be [on the court],” he said. “I have received offers from many NBA teams and elite European clubs but when a player’s body does not let him be as good as he used to be, he now has to bid farewell to the sport. That time has come for Mehmet Okur.”

Known for his high three-point rate for a center, the 33-year-old player spent 10 seasons in the NBA, winning one league title with the Pistons in 2004, making him the only Turkish player to have a championship ring. After two seasons with the Pistons, Okur moved to the Jazz, where he averaged 15.1 points and 7.7 rebounds per game during seven seasons. He was selected to play in the 2007 All-Star game as well, being the only Turk ever to participate in the NBA’s showcase event.

Last year, he was traded to the Brooklyn Nets, however, he could only play 17 matches for the franchise.

Federer hails Djokovic as ‘real’ number 1

Tennis great Roger Federer is in no doubt that Novak Djokovic deserves to finish 2012 as the world’s top-ranked player.

Federer replaced Djokovic at the top of the standings after winning Wimbledon in July but ceded the number one position to the Serb yesterday.

And with the Swiss star unable to improve on last year’s perfect performance in winning the 2011 season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London, not even an unblemished victory in this year’s edition at the O2 Arena will see him regain top spot before 2012 is out.

“We know who the real number one is,” said Federer. “It is going to be Novak. I do not think there should be any debate around about that.

“You do not get to number one by chance. The rankings are something that shows how you have played over a 365-day period. It might all change again in two months at the Australian Open but now it is clear.”

‘I gave it all’

Federer all but conceded the top ranking this year when opting out of the Paris Masters last week on the grounds he could not do himself justice by playing successive tournaments in Basle, Paris and London.

“I obviously gave it everything I had,” said Federer. “I’ve played so much tennis the last two years and I’m happy I got back to world number one. It’s a time where you need to win at least a slam, or at least five to 10 titles, so we’re not talking about just a quick jump to number one and then you lose it again.

“So I’m putting my schedule into place for next year and there are no extraordinary changes.”

Although Djokovic has failed to hit the same heights as in 2011, when he won three Grand Slam singles titles, this year has seen him retain his Australia Open crown and reach the finals of both the French and US Opens, losing the latter to Andy Murray.

Fatigue caught up with Djokovic in London last year and he suffered a shock loss to Sam Querrey in Paris.

And Djokovic, who begins his London campaign against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga said it was tough to be in peak shape at this stage of a long season.

“It is expected not to be always in your top form at this time of year,” he said. “The effects of the long season can influence you physically and mentally but this is an important tournament and I want to do well.”

Old foes Beşiktaş and Bursa meet in Super League clash at İnönü
The Beşiktaş Black Eagles will entertain Bursaspor’s Green Crocs at İnönü Stadium in what is expected to be a tense match on Friday evening.

There has been bad blood between the two teams since the end of the 2003-2004 season, when a Beşiktaş loss to Rizespor allowed Rize’s team to gain rank over Bursa. That incident alone turned the friendship of the two teams into animosity and a majority of games between the two teams began to see violent encounters between their fans.

As a result Bursaspor fans will be banned from Friday’s away match in İstanbul, a common pre-emptive measure taken ahead of games when a risk of violence is present.

Violent behavior by fans led to the cancelation of a game between the two teams last year. In May 2011, the Bursaspor-Beşiktaş match was called off due to boisterous fans in the Bursa crowd. The Turkish Football Federation (TFF) board declared a 0-3 loss for Bursaspor in the game.

In Friday’s game, neither side can afford another loss in the Spor Toto Super League as both teams have already started to drift from their targets. Beşiktaş struggled into seventh place with a 3-0 victory over second-to-last-place Mersin İdman Yurdu last weekend. Bursaspor fell to ninth after Kasımpaşa handed it a 2-1 home loss.

Beşiktaş is missing striker Mustafa Pektemek, who will be sidelined for another three months due to a knee injury, while it is still not clear whether or not defender İbrahim Toraman, who is also suffering from an injury, can make it to the game.

Bursaspor has a full squad available with the exception of goalkeeper Scott Carson, who is out on an injury.

In games between the two, history shows Beşiktaş clearly on top of Bursaspor with 35 to 16 victories and 112 to 76 goals. The teams have ended 35 games in a tie. Bursaspor has had little luck playing in İstanbul, with a record of only four wins at İnönü Stadium. Beşiktaş won both games last season.

Also on Friday, a mediocre Sivasspor hosts third-placed Eskişehirspor. Sivasspor Coach Rıza Çalımbay complained about the injuries on his team and cited his difficulty in making a strong line-up. He expressed his faith that Sivasspor will improve over time.

Consider salad for the next Eid al-Adha 
Meals of grilled, roasted and boiled meat preserve their special place on tables set for Eid al-Adha, the Feast of the Sacrifice. But do not forget to eat salad as well as meat as much as possible during the holiday.

During Eid al-Adha, meat is abundant as a result of fulfilling the religious obligations of the holiday. One must be sure that the meat is prepared in a clean environment from the stages of slaughtering to cooking. But nutritionists also warn that overconsumption of red meat can cause heart disease and suggest that salad should be eaten with meals including meat. Salads, rich in pulp, limit the absorption of cholesterol in red meat, according to nutritionist Hayrettin Mutlu. Mutlu says people consume nearly a kilogram of red meat per day during Eid al-Adha, affecting negatively the levels of cholesterol and uric acid in human blood. Those with high cholesterol should be especially careful with the quantity of meat they consume, he says. Mutlu also noted that the meat of a slaughtered animal should not be eaten for the first six to eight hours, and that ideally a full day should pass before the meat is consumed.

Tomatoes and cucumber are not enough

Consuming foods rich in pulp and fiber, like salads, stimulates the intestines and limits the absorption of cholesterol found in red meat. But the fats in red meat can also assist in the body's absorption of fat soluble vitamins found in salads, says Mutlu.

"While preparing a salad we should take advantage of seasonal vegetables and fruits. Eating only tomatoes and cucumber with meat does indicate a healthy entrée. You should try to prepare your salads with vegetables that are rich in vitamin C such as green pepper, parsley, watercress, arugula, cauliflower and spinach. Moreover, eating salad with meat supports the digestive system."

Mammograms: For 1 life saved, 3 women overtreated 
Breast cancer screening for women over 50 saves lives, an independent panel in Britain has concluded, confirming findings in US and other studies.

But that screening comes with a cost: The review found that for every life saved, roughly three other women were overdiagnosed, meaning they were unnecessarily treated for a cancer that would never have threatened their lives. The expert panel was commissioned by Cancer Research UK and Britain’s department of health and analyzed evidence from 11 trials in Canada, Sweden, the UK and the US.

In Britain, mammograms are usually offered to women aged 50 to 70 every three years as part of the state-funded breast cancer screening program. Scientists said the British program saves about 1,300 women every year from dying of breast cancer while about 4,000 women are overdiagnosed. By that term, experts mean women treated for cancers that grow too slowly to ever put their lives at risk. This is different from another screening problem: false alarms, which occur when suspicious mammograms lead to biopsies and follow-up tests to rule out cancers that were not present. The study did not look at the false alarm rate. “It’s clear that screening saves lives,” said Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK. “But some cancers will be treated that would never have caused any harm and unfortunately, we can’t yet tell which cancers are harmful and which are not.”

Each year, more than 300,000 women aged 50 to 52 are offered a mammogram through the British program. During the next 20 years of screening every three years, 1 percent of them will get unnecessary treatment such as chemotherapy, surgery or radiation for a breast cancer that wouldn’t ever be dangerous. The review was published online Tuesday in the Lancet journal. Some critics said the review was a step in the right direction. “Cancer charities and public health authorities have been misleading women for the past two decades by giving too rosy a picture of the benefits,” said Karsten Jorgensen, a researcher at the Nordic Cochrane Centre in Copenhagen who has previously published papers on overdiagnosis.

“It’s important they have at least acknowledged screening causes substantial harms,” he said, adding that countries should now re-evaluate their own breast cancer programs.

In the US, a government-appointed task force of experts recommends women at average risk of cancer get mammograms every two years starting at age 50. But the American Cancer Society and other groups advise women to get annual mammograms starting at age 40. In recent years, the British breast screening program has been slammed for focusing on the benefits of mammograms and downplaying the risks.

Maggie Wilcox, a breast cancer survivor and member of the expert panel, said the current information on mammograms given to British women was inadequate.

“I went into [screening] blindly without knowing about the possibility of overdiagnosis,” said Wilcox, 70, who had a mastectomy several years ago. “I just thought, ‘it’s good for you, so you do it’.”

Knowing what she knows now about the problem of overtreatment, Wilcox says she still would have chosen to get screened. “But I would have wanted to know enough to make an informed choice for myself.”

How to beat insomnia and sleep easy

Lack of sleep can blight lives and ruin health, and more than half of us suffer from it. Here's how the latest scientific research can help you to get a good night's rest

Poor sleep – as anyone who suffers from it knows – can make life a misery. And it is taking its toll on the nation's health. According to the recently published Great British Sleep Survey, more than 51% of us now struggle to get a good night's sleep, with women three times more likely to be affected than men.

Evidence collected from 20,000-plus adults between March 2010 and this June shows that 93% of insomniacs report low energy levels and 83% complain of mood swings. Some 77% find it hard to concentrate, 64% say they are less productive at work, and 55% report relationship difficulties.

Even worse, persistent poor sleep can increase the risk of developing conditions including diabetes, depression, high blood pressure and strokes. Research at the University of British Columbia suggests every hour of sleep lost at night may cost us one IQ point the following day. And it is often a long-term issue: a quarter of people with insomnia have suffered from it for more than 10 years.

In Britain, overwhelmingly, we treat poor sleep with medication: the NHS spent a staggering £50m on sleeping pills last year, with 15.3m prescriptions dispensed across England, Scotland and Wales (up 17% in three years). But many pills have undesirable side-effects and the survey's findings suggest they do not solve long-term sleep problems: 42% of people who have taken them on and off have continued to have poor sleep for more than a decade.

So how can we do something about poor sleep without pills? Most people focus first on what Colin Espie, professor of clinical psychology and director of the University of Glasgow Sleep Centre, calls "sleep hygiene": our pre-bed routine, and the physical environment in which we try to sleep. Espie believes these factors account for a mere 10% of sleep problems: "most people with insomnia have better sleep hygiene than easy sleepers". But most sleep experts concur that the following do make a difference.

Light. A dark room is important to a good sleep. Also try to avoid "blue light" less than two hours before bed: research by the Lighting Research Centre at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York State suggests light from laptop, tablet and smartphone screens tricks us into thinking it is daytime and keeps us alert, although this has been disputed. Bedrooms should be a comfortable temperature (around 18C), quiet and well-ventilated, with comfortable beds and pillows

Food, drink, exercise. Anything that stimulates the system – such as caffeine (although some experimental studies show a cup of coffee may lengthen the time taken to drop off by just three minutes), alcohol, chocolate, tobacco, a heavy meal or strenuous exercise – will make it harder to get to sleep. Indigestible foods are obviously best avoided; carbohydrates can promote serotonin, which aids sleep. Aim for a regular, balanced diet and no late-night excess. Twenty minutes a day of exercise will make a big difference to your sleep, but avoid it just before bed.

Sleep debt. A weekend lie-in or afternoon snooze can do more harm than good. According to research at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Centre, "sleep debt" is best "repaid" by getting up and going to bed at your normal times rather than disrupting your body clock. Save sleep for bedtime: naps are recommended only if you are too exhausted to function.

Age. Not strictly sleep hygiene, and not much you can do about it either, but it may help to know that it can get harder to sleep as you get older. Research by the University of Washington Medicine Sleep Centre and others has shown our "sleep architecture" changes as we age: older people spend less time in deeper, non-REM sleep, and their whole body clock or circadian rhythm moves forward.

"Sleep hygiene" alone, however, will not determine whether or not we sleep well. Ninety per cent of the battle is in the mind, which is why talking therapies and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) are coming to be seen as perhaps the most useful solution. Espie helped launch Sleepio, a pioneering online CBT programme that has won praise from the medical press, including the Lancet and the peer-reviewed journal Sleep. In a full clinical trial, it helped 75% of people with long-term poor sleep.
